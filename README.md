## Automation Coverage

### Fully Automated (Playwright)

These brokers run without any manual steps. Turnstile-protected ones require a CapSolver API key.

| Broker | CAPTCHA | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| TruePeopleSearch | — | Headless browser |
| FastPeopleSearch | — | Headless browser |
| FamilyTreeNow | — | Headless browser |
| BeenVerified | Turnstile ¹ | Email verification to finalize |
| PeopleFinders | Turnstile ¹ | Email confirmation to finalize |
| Intelius | Turnstile ¹ | PeopleConnect suppression center — also covers ZabaSearch, TruthFinder, InstantCheckmate |
| ZabaSearch | Turnstile ¹ | Same as Intelius |
| ClustrMaps | Turnstile ¹ | Email confirmation to finalize |
| VoterRecords | Cloudflare ² | Falls back to manual if blocked |
| PublicRecordsNow | Cloudflare ² | Falls back to manual if blocked |
| Smart Background Checks | Cloudflare ² | Falls back to manual if blocked |
| ThatsThem | reCAPTCHA v2 ¹ | Falls back to manual if blocked |

¹ Requires `CAPSOLVER_API_KEY` in `.env`
² Cloudflare Enterprise — automation may be blocked depending on IP

### Email Automated (SMTP)

Requires `SMTP_*` credentials in `.env`.

| Broker | Contact |

## Optional: CAPTCHA Solving (CapSolver)

Some brokers (BeenVerified, PeopleFinders, Intelius, ZabaSearch, ClustrMaps, ThatsThem) require solving a Cloudflare Turnstile or reCAPTCHA challenge. Incognish integrates with [CapSolver](https://capsolver.com) to handle this automatically.

**Cost:** ~$0.80–1.00 per 1,000 solves. A full opt-out run uses ~5 solves — under $0.01/run. Minimum deposit is $5 (~1,250 runs).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your key:
# CAPSOLVER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Without a key, Turnstile-protected brokers fall back to `manual_required`.

---

## Optional: Email Opt-Outs

Some brokers accept a GDPR/CCPA removal request by email. To automate these:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your SMTP credentials
```

For Gmail, use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833).

## Adding a New Broker

1. Add an entry to `brokers/registry.json`
2. Optionally create `brokers/handlers/yourbroker.py` with a `Handler` class extending `BaseHandler`
3. Set `"handler": "yourbroker"` in the registry entry

PRs to improve the broker registry are welcome!

## Data Privacy

- All data lives in `db/tracker.db` (SQLite) on your machine
- `db/` is gitignored — never committed
- No analytics, no telemetry, no external calls except to broker websites (and CapSolver if configured)
